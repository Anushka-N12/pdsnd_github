### Project Title: BikeShare Analysis

### Description:
 - This task is a part of the coursework required to finish the "Data Science with Python" nanodegree. 
 - I was given a dataset of a BikeShare company, which included start & stop times, stations and user data.
 - I made an interactive script that gave statistics based on given time restrictions.
 - I then forked one of Udacity's repositories and made changes, practicing various commands in Git.

### Files used:
 - Given datasets were downloadable resources as part of the "Introduction to Python" course.
 - They were 3 CSV files, of 3 cities in the USA: Chicago, New York City & Washington.
